### CPSC 120

* Lab 3 

I found lab three part one to be very enjoyable since I never knew BMR could be calculate via code. As a person who loves fitness, I really enjoyed knowing my BMR and my friends as well. 
This lab has helped me to grasp the basics of int, double, cin and cout commands, which was very important in later labs. 

* Lab 4

I found lab 4 part 2 to be quite memorable since it was the first miniature game me and my partner coded. This game was called the Hi-Lo Guessing Game where a player wold choose a secret number and another would guess the number. Getting the number correct results in an output that tells them they have won. If not then the player is given a hint whether their answer was too high or too low. If they get it wrong the second time the game is a loss and the number is revealed. This lab introduced me to if statements which made me feel like coding can also be very fun and rewarding. 

* Lab 7

Lab 7 was about creating functions that will allow the user to know when to and when not to park on the street in case of a street sweeping. I personally have gotten a ticket for this before and I surely do not enjoy it. This lab taught me how to use what I have learned thus far to better my life and those around me. I felt like this was very helpful and seeing coding helping people avoid unwanted tickets is very enjoyable to me.
